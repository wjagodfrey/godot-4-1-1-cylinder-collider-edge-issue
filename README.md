This project contains three cubes for the player to collide against.

1. Imported cube with a `ConcavePolygonShape3D` collider
1. Imported cube with a `ConvexPolygonShape3D` collider
1. In-engine cube with a `BoxShape3D` collider

The cylinder `CharacterBody3D` only gets stuck on the corners of the first.

## Controls
WSAD and mouse look.
